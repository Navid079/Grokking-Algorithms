Since the number of items are doubled, the number of steps will be increased by one:

```math
	log_2(2n) = log_2(2) + log_2(n) = 1 + log_2(n)
```
We know that the number of items in the list was 128 previously. So:
```math
	steps = (log_2(128 \times 2)) + 1 = (log_2(128) + 1) + 1 = (7 + 1) + 1 = 9
```
This shows how powerful `binary_search` is; Each time we double the number of the items, the algorithm will only need to add one more step for finding an item in the list. Here are some examples of steps needed for search to complete:

|$n_{items}$|$steps$|
